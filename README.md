# CV Parser

### This project is using an external API called LLamaparse which is an extension of a pretrained language model, further trained using my prompt engineering, to 
### yield the results needed, within a JSON format. 

### This project is displayed using a UI called Gradio, which within the ouput of the parser will then be matched to the required labels to be filled as menitoend in the gradio formatting.
